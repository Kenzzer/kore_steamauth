# Kore SteamAuth
A rough implementation of [xPaw's SteamOpenID](https://github.com/xPaw/SteamOpenID.php) in C with [Kore](https://kore.io/).

Much like the PHP version, this implementation only offers OpenID validation against hardcoded Steam server.
Before using any code from this repository please read [Steam Web API Documentation](https://steamcommunity.com/dev).
